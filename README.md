### Sass (short for syntactically awesome style sheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
### SassScript is the scripting language itself

#### Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time.

#### Sass example:

/* Define standard variables and values for website */
$bgcolor: lightblue;

/* Use the variables */
body {
  background-color: $bgcolor;
}

##### In this repository, I created a landing page using Sass. The website is responsive and uses CSS Grid and Flexbox.
